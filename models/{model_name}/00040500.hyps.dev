the congressors Keith Ellison and John Lewis have a legislative proposal in order to establish the organisation of trade unions .
`` such as progressive chairman , &apos;&apos; the Middle Ellison , &apos;&apos; said Ellison , a Democratio from Minnesota and the Progressive Caucus in the Congress .
therefore , I am proud to be proudly proutilization with the civil law .
the same legal opportunities of workers , the same legal possibilities of discrimination because the organisation of the organization of unions , such as other forms of discrimination - and doubtless of discrimination .
the implementation of the national labour law in order to create an opportunity for a discrimination of the workers to establish a universal representation to the organisation of a universal report - and in order to maintain justice - and to claim or crimination - is a sense of civil and necessary initiative .
but it is not a radical initiative - in any case not after American standards .
indeed , the best way to understand the best way to understand what Ellison , Lewis and the further sponsor of their legislative propose that the connection to a very American idea .
however , despite the backgrounds in the past few years were exposed - in knowledge and other states in all the world - have been encouraged in all over the world - have been encouraged in all over the world .
it was a time to remillions of Americans still remind when this country democracy , freedom , freedom , press freedom and the United States in an appointment .
as the United States , the Second World War Japan , Japan , was encouraging General Douglas Mac Arthur and his state the country to make a constitution of a constitution .
in full awareness , that the workers and their trade unions in the creation of a new Japan an an role , the expliciting of a language that ` the workers &apos; rights of the workers &apos; rights of the United States and common negotiating .
as the United States , the Second World War , David Eisenhower , the General David Eisenhower , and his state the Constitution , a constitution that would be a strong democracy .
in recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organise their voice , and their voice in the new nation , the Deutsche a Klauza &apos;s explicitarian : ` the right to work and improve the work and improvements and improve the labour and economic conditions and environmental conditions and improve everyone .
agreements with this right or to avoid the right or to avoid it , and nothing more and nothing ; it is to be determined .
as the former of Lady Eleanor Roosevelt , the Presidency of the International Human Rights Commission , which has been reached by the general statement of human rights , such as the 1948 by the United Nations of Human Rights .
since generations Americans , Americans , Americans have been the focus of human rights .
in this country , in other countries , such as civil and democratic societies , Americans , that Americans are the right to take place on the grounds of a universal partners , and to participate .
according to these rights in America , the America is very much , the American ideal ideal staff , according to the labour population , according to the working population and that is a free and open society in a free and open society .
as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr.
the history is a great deal of light .
now all the fact that the worker movement of nation does not restrict , but it failed .
through the expansion of the living standards of millions of people , work for the industrial and the entire nation of inspired production .
those who forget the work of work , forget , but the history of these simple truths , but the history .
the history remind and we should do .
the formal recognition of work as human rights and the enlargement of the protection of citizens &apos; rights as human rights and the enlargement of protecting workers - is long-term .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis again the ideal , the America &apos;s promise and the promise of democracy .
